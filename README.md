# Moving to GitHub

## Welcome!

The C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.  

## Getting Started

Are you new to the C++ Rest SDK? To get going we recommend you start by taking a look at our [tutorial](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Http%20Client%20Tutorial) to use the http_client. It walks through how to setup a project to use the C++ Rest SDK and make a basic Http request. Other important information, like how to build the C++ Rest SDK from source, can be located on the [documentation](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/documentation) page.  

## What's in the SDK:

*   Features - HTTP client/server, JSON, URI, asynchronous streams, WebSockets client, oAuth
*   PPL Tasks - A powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based on C++ 11 features
*   Platforms - Windows desktop, Windows Store, Windows Phone, Ubuntu, OS X, iOS, and Android
*   Support for Visual Studio 2012, 2013, and 2015 with debugger visualizers
*   NuGet package with binaries for Windows and Android platforms

## Contribute Back!

Is there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced).  

Big or small we'd like to take your [contributions](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Make%20a%20contribution&referringTitle=Documentation) back to help improve the C++ Rest SDK for everyone. If interested contact us askcasablanca at Microsoft dot com.  

## Having Trouble?

We'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open a [discussion](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/discussions) or track it under [issues](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic?field=Votes&direction=Descending&issuesToDisplay=Open&keywords=&emailSubscribedItemsOnly=false&size=50).
